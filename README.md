Standalone modding software for the video game ZERO Sievert by CABO Studio.
It replaces the Display names of the weapons in the game in a non-destructive way.

I'm currently working on a Version 2 that improves quality of life.
But this version works regardless.

For a tutorial how to use it, read the Itch.io page.
